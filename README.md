# Redux Sight Words

## A concept Redux project with Webpack, ReactJS, and ES6

I have been playing with some concepts in React with regards to style, and making an easier conversion to React Native with minimal effort.  This is my first step which is extracting the render implementation.  I basically took some basic html and made replacement react components.  The thought here is to have all of my app work with these UI interface of sorts.  I am thinking that I could change those components depending on whether I am doing a web build or a native build.  

I am also working on creating/implementing some sort of total JS style (still in conceptual phase).  I would love some feed back on this, especially if someone has done this before with react web apps and react native apps.
